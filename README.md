My Android mobile app project with friends when I was attend college in 2023

Description: The HerbCam project is an Android mobile application designed with the main objective of detecting and classifying herbal plants. Developed using Java programming language, the application leverages deep learning techniques for object detection, specifically utilizing the YOLOv5 architecture and model. With a database comprising 30 distinct classes of herbal plants, users can conveniently detect and classify these plants in real-time or from images stored in their device's gallery. HerbCam serves as a valuable tool for plant enthusiasts, researchers, and hobbyists alike, providing efficient and accurate plant identification on-the-go.
